title: CNC-E-2726320-176B-TAR Outbound to SMB/WebDAV Ports (Sysmon EID 3)
id: 5f1b2b5a-91f8-4f1f-9d76-2726320176bb
status: test
description: |
  Flags network connections made by tar.exe to ports associated with SMB or WebDAV:
  445 (SMB) and 80/443 (HTTP/S via WebDAV mini-redirector). tar.exe is not an HTTP
  client; outbound traffic typically indicates it was pointed at a UNC path that the OS
  resolved to SMB or WebDAV, consistent with T1105-style ingress/copy from remote hosts.

falsepositives:
  - Tar-based workflows that legitimately access internal SMB shares (port 445).
  - Rare environments using WebDAV for content distribution. Tune with allow-lists of corporate WebDAV hosts/domains; investigate first-seen external destinations.
