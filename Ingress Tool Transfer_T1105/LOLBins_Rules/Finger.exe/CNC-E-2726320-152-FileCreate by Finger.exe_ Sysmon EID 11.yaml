title: CNC-E-2726320-153-Finger.exe FileCreate (Unexpected — Sysmon EID 11)
id: 0c5f4c5d-2f2c-4cb0-9f53-2726320153aa
status: test
description: |
  Detects any file creation event attributed to finger.exe (Sysmon Event ID 11).
  The Finger client is a legacy/deprecated protocol tool used to query remote user
  information over TCP/79 and does not normally write files to disk. Therefore,
  any FileCreate by finger.exe is unusual and should be investigated to rule out
  misuse, staging, or tooling masquerade.

falsepositives:
  - Extremely rare. Potential cases include custom admin/test scripts that redirect or tee output in a way that attributes a write to finger.exe, or lab environments experimenting with legacy tools.
  - Validate parent process, command line, and whether the destination path is user-writable or sensitive; in normal use, finger.exe should not create files.
