title: CNC-E-2726320-151-Finger.exe Network Connection to TCP/79 (Sysmon EID 3)
id: 9f4b1d7b-6f2b-4c6a-9f51-2726320151aa
status: test
description: |
  Detects the legacy Finger client (finger.exe) establishing a network connection observed by
  Sysmon Event ID 3 to TCP port 79 (Finger protocol). Finger is a deprecated protocol; any use—
  even by administrators—should be considered suspicious and investigated. Validate whether the
  connection targets an internal host or an external destination and whether there is a legitimate
  administrative need.

falsepositives:
  - Rare administrative troubleshooting or testing of legacy services (should be exceptional).
  # Tuning tips:
  # - Check if the destination is external or unapproved; prefer alerting on outbound to the internet.
  # - Correlate with process creation telemetry (cmdline, parent process) and user context to verify intent.
