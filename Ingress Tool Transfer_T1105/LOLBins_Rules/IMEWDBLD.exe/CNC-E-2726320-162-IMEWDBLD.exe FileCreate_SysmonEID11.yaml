title: CNC-E-2726320-162-IMEWDBLD.exe FileCreate (Unexpected — Sysmon EID 11)
id: e8a9b2f7-6d0d-4e95-9e8e-2726320162aa
status: test
description: |
  Detects any file creation attributed to IMEWDBLD.exe (Sysmon Event ID 11).
  IMEWDBLD.exe is associated with Microsoft’s IME dictionary maintenance; routine local
  writes are uncommon outside of legitimate dictionary update workflows. Any FileCreate
  by IMEWDBLD.exe should be reviewed to determine if it’s a sanctioned update or abuse
  for staging/dropping content.

falsepositives:
  - Legitimate IME dictionary updates (especially on systems actively using Japanese/Chinese/Korean IMEs).
  - Tuning tip: correlate with Windows Update activity, signed Microsoft binaries as parents, and expected file locations; allow-list if consistently benign in your environment.
