title: CNC-E-2726320-202-MSAccess Network Connection (Sysmon EID 3)
id: 7f0ab8de-6d7a-45f5-9ab3-2726320202aa
status: test
description: |
  Flags network connections attributed to MSAccess.exe. Access is primarily a desktop
  database application and does not typically initiate arbitrary Internet egress by itself.
  Network activity following an MSAccess launch with a URL (or activity to unknown Internet domains)
  can indicate Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105). Review the destination domain/IP and correlate with
  recent process-creation events and INetCache file writes.
