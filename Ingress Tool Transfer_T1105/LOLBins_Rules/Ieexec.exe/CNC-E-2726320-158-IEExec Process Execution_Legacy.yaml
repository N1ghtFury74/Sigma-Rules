status: test
description: |
  Detects execution of IEExec.exe — a legacy .NET/ClickOnce Internet Explorer helper.
  In 2025 this binary is effectively obsolete/unsupported and should not be needed in
  modern environments. Any invocation warrants investigation for abuse (e.g., app
  whitelisting bypass) or legacy artifact resurfacing.
  Note : Microsoft later removed/obsoleted IEExec (and IEHost) in .NET Framework 4 era; those assemblies are not supported and Microsoft points 
  developers to alternatives like ClickOnce or XBAP/Silverlight (also legacy). That deprecation is why IEExec is mostly seen today as a living-off-the-land 
  artifact rather than a supported app platform.

falsepositives:
  - Rare legacy or lab/testing scenarios intentionally invoking IEExec for research.
  - Tuning tip: if truly required by a legacy workflow, allow-list specific hosts/users and documented cmdlines; otherwise treat as suspicious.
